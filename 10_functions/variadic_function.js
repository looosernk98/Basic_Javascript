/*
 These are functions that accept a variable number of arguments (255 being the limit). 
 You can think of them as function grammars that support word endings 
 such as, “a, b, c, and so on”. Variadic functions are also known as Varargs functions.

If a function takes a fixed number of arguments, it is not variadic. A variadic 
function can be used as a function that is not fixed to a specific number of arguments. 
You can pass it an arbitrary number of arguments.

Math.min() and Math.max() in JavaScript are also examples of variadic functions, 
as they are used to find the lowest or highest value in a list of arguments.
