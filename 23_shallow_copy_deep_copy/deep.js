/*

-> Deep copy creates a new object and recursively copies the elements of the original object, including any objects referenced within it.
-> The new object has its own memory locations for all the elements, including the referenced objects.
-> Changes made to the elements in the deep copy do not affect the original object or any other copied objects.
-> Deep copy is a relatively slower operation and requires more memory, especially for complex data structures.
-> Deep copy is suitable when you want to create a completely independent copy of an object, including all its nested objects.


Use deep copy when:

-> You need a completely independent copy of the original object.
-> You want to modify the copied elements without affecting the original ones.
-> The structure youâ€™re copying contains nested objects or collections that also need to be copied.

Using Object.assign() method
Using Json.parse() and Json.stringify()
