// Comparison operators compare two values and return a boolean value, either true or false.


// ==	Equal to: returns true if the operands are equal	x == y
// !=	Not equal to: returns true if the operands are not equal	x != y
// ===	Strict equal to: true if the operands are equal and of the same type	x === y
// !==	Strict not equal to: true if the operands are equal but of different type or not equal at all	x !== y
// >	Greater than: true if left operand is greater than the right operand	x > y
// >=	Greater than or equal to: true if left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand	x >= y
// <	Less than: true if the left operand is less than the right operand	x < y
// <=	Less than or equal to: true if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand	x <= y

// a is bigger than b
// a > b OR  b < a
